			Welcome to my website! My name is Karni and I am an aspiring software engineer with a
			Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from California State University Fullerton. My goal is
			to create with a purpose. There is not a lot of Indian representation in the entertainment or
			art field. I aim to build my projects and identity surrounding my culture so that it brings
			awareness to those who may be curious or those who may be misinformed about <u><i>us</i></u>.
